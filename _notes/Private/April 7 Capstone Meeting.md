# April 7 Meeting Agenda

## Research Abstract (250 words)

The exponential increase in the amount of data we are processing nowadays demands an easier and faster way to interact with them. While the current practices to store data are optimized to general applications, there is a need for faster and smaller data structures that are non-deterministic. In this capstone, I intend to explore the various techniques that facilitates data querying. Some of these aspects includes using ML models for indexes and sorting, sketching techniques that gives approximate answers, and Generative Adversarial Networks that synthesize smaller datasets [^1-4]. I will start with a comprehensive literature review of existing research, formalize a specific problem I will address in the research, and then propose a solution that I expect to perform queries with better time or space requirements than existing systems. A potential deliverable for the capstone would be an implementation of the solution and a comparison of its performance against the other systems.

## GANs for Synthetic Relational Data
Finished reading section 1-5, will finish reading the remaining sections ASAP.

> How much does privacy matters? Do I need to get into **differential privacy**?

> When evaluating performance on approximate query processing, why do we compare the estimate from synthetic table with a **sample from the original table** not the actual estimate? 



## Second Grader
Any recommedations on the second grader?


## Next Steps
- What should I read next? 
	- Synapses for Massive Data
	- More on synthetic data generation? or learned data structures?
- What should be the deliverables for the capstone
